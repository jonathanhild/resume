Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{24pt}

\hspace{24pt}The best way to describe myself as a data analyst is that I love "analyst" part of the job. What this means to me is investigating, finding insights, and informing others in what data says. I have been working with data, computers, and statistics in some form for several years. However, I get energized with gaining new information and utilizing it to help others. This was my main motivation to leave the food industry in 2020, complete a Certificate in Data Science from UW, and find a full-time position as a data analyst. I'm looking for a company where I can be part of a collaborative team by delivering insights and analysis.

\vspace{12pt}

\hspace{24pt}For an example, one project I'm proud of is creating a Power BI dashboard to track FDA recall data because I had little prior technology experience. I taught myself how to connect directly to company databases and the FDA API to get updates in real time. Another was a spec management application in Access, which I taught myself programming and databases to implement. I'm highly technical and detail-oriented in my work. I like to dive into things that are unfamiliar to me, which I can learn and grow skills along the way to get to the goal. I have a lot more projects and technical skills on my resume that should match up with the needs of the job.

\vspace{12pt}

\hspace{24pt}The most important skills I have though are in communication. First and foremost is being a good listener. These projects often required understanding how other people work, so it became a necessity to focus on what they were meaning and ask the important questions to get to the root of what they want. Second, is writing. One of my projects was writing a detailed summary of the food safety practices at Oregon Spice Company that made it easier to give information to our customers. One trick I used was color and iconography to help the reader scan the 40-page document for relevant information. Third is verbal communication. Part of food safety is educating people on technical safety standards. Sometimes with unfriendly customers/suppliers, or coworkers with limited English skills. Overall, I approach communication by finding mutuality with other people.

\vspace{12pt}

\hspace{24pt}My salary expectation would be \$45,000 per year, but I'm in such a place in my life that I'm extremely flexible. My main deciding factor is a work nice work environment with a great team of people. I would like to talk further about what I can bring to the Program Data Analyst \& Coordinator position at Children's Cancer Association.

\vspace{24pt}

Sincerely,

\vspace{12pt}

Jonathan Hildenbrand
